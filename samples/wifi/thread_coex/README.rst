Wi-Fi: Thread coexistence
#########################

.. contents::

   :depth: 2

The Thread coexistence sample demonstrates coexistence between Wi-FiÂ® and OpenThread device radios in 2.4 GHz frequency.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kit:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

Running test cases for this sample requires additional software, such as the Wi-Fi **iPerf** application.
Use iPerf version 2.0.5.
For more details, see `Network Traffic Generator`_.

Overview
********

The sample demonstrates how the coexistence mechanism is implemented, and how it can be enabled and disabled between Wi-Fi and Thread radios in the 2.4 GHz band.
This is done by using the throughput of the Wi-Fi client and the Thread client, as well as the throughput of the Wi-Fi client and the Thread server.

Test setup
==========

The following figure shows a reference test setup.

     Wi-Fi and Thread coexistence reference test and evaluation setup

The reference test setup shows the connections between the following devices:

* :term:`Device Under Test (DUT)` (nRF7002 DK on which the coexistence sample runs)
* Wi-Fi peer device (access point with test PC that runs iPerf)
* Thread peer device (nRF7002 DK on which Thread-only throughput runs)

The following table provides more details on the sample or application that runs on DUT and peer devices:

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/wifi/thread_coex`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run_ns.txt

To build for the nRF7002 DK, use the ``nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp`` board target.
The following are examples of the CLI commands:

* Build with coexistence disabled:

  .. code-block:: console

     west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_MPSL_CX=n -Dipc_radio_CONFIG_MPSL_CX=n

Use this command to run the tests with coexistence disabled mode.

* Build with coexistence enabled:

  .. code-block:: console

     west build -p -b nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp -- -DCONFIG_MPSL_CX=y -Dipc_radio_CONFIG_MPSL_CX=y

Use this command to run the tests with coexistence enabled mode.

Change the board target as given below for the nRF7001 DK, nRF7002 EK, and nRF7001 EK.

* Board target for nRF7001 DK:

  .. code-block:: console

     nrf7002dk/nrf5340/cpuapp/nrf7001

* Board target for nRF7002 EK and nRF7001 EK:

  .. code-block:: console

     nrf5340dk/nrf5340/cpuapp

Add the following SHIELD options for the nRF7002 EK and nRF7001 EK.

* For nRF7002 EK:

  .. code-block:: console

     -Dthread_coex_SHIELD="nrf7002ek;nrf7002ek_coex"
     -Dipc_radio_SHIELD="nrf7002ek_coex"

* For nRF7001 EK:

  .. code-block:: console

     -Dthread_coex_SHIELD="nrf7002ek_nrf7001;nrf7002ek_coex"
     -Dipc_radio_SHIELD="nrf7002ek_coex"

* Overlay files

   * Use the :file:`overlay-wifi-udp-client-thread-udp-client.conf` file to build for both Wi-Fi and Thread in client roles.
   * Use the :file:`overlay-wifi-udp-client-thread-udp-server.conf` file to build for Wi-Fi in the client role and Thread in the server role.

The generated HEX file to be used is :file:`thread_coex/build/merged.hex`.

#. Wi-Fi client and Thread server:

Test procedure is like the Wi-Fi client and Thread client described above except that the thread role set to server on the DUT and client on the peer.

Observe that the Wi-Fi throughput result appears on the test PC terminal on which iPerf server is run.
The Thread throughput result appears on the minicom terminal connected to the nRF7002 DK, on which Thread is run in the client role.

Results
=======

The following tables summarize the results obtained from coexistence tests conducted in a clean RF environment for different Wi-Fi operating bands, with Wi-Fi and Thread data rates set to 10 Mbps and 65 kbps, respectively.
These results are representative and might vary based on the RSSI and the level of external interference.

The Wi-Fi and Thread channels (both in the 2.4 GHz band) are selected to overlap, thereby maximizing interference.
Tests are run using separate antenna configurations only, as Thread does not support shared antenna configurations due to being in idle listening mode when not active.

The results show that coexistence harmonizes airtime between Wi-Fi and Thread rather than resulting in a higher combined throughput.
This is consistent with the design intent.
